### Auto kick?
If a player builds a reactor too close to the core. That reactor gets destroyed and the player gets a warning in chat. 
Auto kick is by default disabled but you can enable it in the server console using `antinuke-kick <on/off>`.
If this option is enabled the player gets kicked and a servermessage gets send to all the players on the server.
